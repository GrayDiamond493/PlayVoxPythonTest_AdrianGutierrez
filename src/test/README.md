# PlayVox Python Test #

This is my approach for answering the Python Technical test.

## Testing Script ##
In order to use the testing script, run the following command:
`$ python src/test/messages_test.py`

## Explanation ##
This Script proves the result of the same reasoning used to rewrite 
the code, by simulating data stored in the database in a dictionary.
Its purpose is to show in a more practical way that the algoritm
for assembling messages works.
